# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We appreciate your help in disclosing the issue to us responsibly.

Please follow these guidelines when reporting security vulnerabilities to us:

- Email your findings to our security team at [security.kraftgithub@gmail.com](mailto:security.kraftgithub@gmail.com).
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
- If possible, include any proof-of-concept or exploit code that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- Do not disclose the vulnerability to others until we have had an opportunity to address it.
- We will make every effort to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.


## Security Releases

When a security vulnerability is identified and confirmed, we will release a security update as soon as possible. These updates will be labeled with a security version increment (e.g., X.Y.Z-security) to differentiate them from regular releases.
